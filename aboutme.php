                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Paul, a dedicated and friendly developer with a lifelong interest in IT.</p>
                    <p>For years I've had an amateur interest in coding often pulling video-games apart and tweaking scripts in languages like Visual Basic, Lua and C# ...</p>
                    <p>Recently, I enjoyed an opportunity training in the Netmatters Scion Coalition Scheme where I've gained a lot more proficiency and confidence with not just programming, but development as a whole.</p>
                    <p>I am very much looking forward to securing a junior role in a software development career, where I can grow as a developer and contribute towards some awesome projects!</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Skills:&nbsp;</span> HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL</p>

                    <h2>My Interests</h2>
                    <p>I've always loved most kinds of gaming, especially shared experiences and working together to tackle challenges or solve problems, it's great using them as a platform to socialize with friends. I enjoy getting to understand how their mechanics work and whenever possible end up tweaking and modding them to create a better experience.</p>
