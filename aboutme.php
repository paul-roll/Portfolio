            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a hard-working and responsible developer with a lifelong passion for IT, working well in both a team environment and on my own initiative. For years I've had an amateur interest in coding often pulling video-games apart and tweaking scripts in languages like Visual Basic, Lua and C# ...</p>
            <p>Recently, I enjoyed an opportunity training in the Netmatters Scion Coalition Scheme where I've gained a lot more proficiency and confidence with not just programming, but development as a whole while reinforcing my adaptability to challenges and reliable time keeping skills.</p>
            <p>I am enthusiastic, self-motivated and very much looking forward to securing a junior role in a software development career, where I can grow as a developer and contribute towards some awesome projects!</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Skills:&nbsp;</span> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Git, Laravel</p>
